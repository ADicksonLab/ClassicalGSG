* Prediction of Partition Coefficient Using Neural Networks and Molecular Geometric Graph method

In this project, we aim to predict the partition coefficient (~ClassicalGSG~)
value for the small molecules using ML methods.

The partition coefficient is one of the main factors in determining
the drug likeliness of a compound, as it helps determine
bioavailability, solubility, and membrane permeability.

We are employing a recently developed [[https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.03068][Geometric Scattering for Graph]]
(GSG) method to determine a feature set for each molecule. A Deep NN
model is trained on the features of the molecules from the GSG method
to predict partition coefficients.For Deep NN model, we
use [[https://pytorch.org][PyTorch]] as ML framework.
