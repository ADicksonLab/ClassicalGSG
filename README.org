* ClassicalGSG: Prediction of logP Using Classical Molecular Dynamics Atomic Attributes and  Geometric Scattering Graphs

This project is the implementation of a method called ~ClassicalGSG~
and has introduced in [[https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcc.26519][ClassicalGSG: Prediction of logP using classical
molecular force fields and geometric scattering for graphs]].  In this
project, we aim to predict the partition coefficient value for the
small molecules.

Here, we use molecular features generated using a recently developed
method called [[https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.03068][Geometric Scattering for Graphs]] (GSG).  The GSG method
uses the graph structure of molecules to transform atomic attributes
into index-variant molecular features.

The atomic attributes are generated using two classical molecular
dynamics force fields generator tool [[https://cgenff.umaryland.edu][CGenFF]] and [[https://ambermd.org/AmberTools.php][Ambertools]].  We train
ClassicalGSG logP predictor models with neural networks (NNs) which,
are implemented using [[https://pytorch.org][PyTorch]].


* Installation

You should use conda to make a new virtual environment:

#+begin_src sh
  conda create -n myenv python=3.7
  conda activate myenv
#+end_src

Currently you must manually install some of the dependencies using
conda. Do this first:

#+begin_src sh
  conda install -c pytorch pytorch
  conda install -c conda-forge openbabel rdkit
#+end_src


To install from pip:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  pip install classicalgsg
#+END_SRC


You can install from the git repo as well:

#+begin_src sh
pip install git+https://github.com/ADicksonLab/ClassicalGSG.git
#+end_src

# TODO: inform about customizing pytorch installation

* Usage

To use our CGenFF ClassicalGSG logP predictor model run the following command:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
 python -m LogpPredictor_CGenFF [molecule.mol2] [molecule.str]
#+END_SRC

To use our MMFF94 ClassicalGSG logP predictor model run the following command:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
 python -m LogpPredictor_MMFF94  ['smiles']
#+END_SRC

You can generate CGenFF parameter files for your molecule using [[https://cgenff.umaryland.edu][CGenFF]]
online server.

* Dataset
The logP dataset can be downloaded from [[https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4531015][Zenodo]].
